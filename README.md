# Chicago-Crime-EDA
This is an exploratory data analysis on Chicago crime from the years 2012-2016. 
I came across a really interesting dataset on the Chicago Data Portal. It a dataset of the crimes reported from 2012-2016 in Chicago IL. There are over 2 million reported crimes in this dataset. I wanted to do an Exploratory Data Analysis and see if I can find something interesting.

# Data Cleaning
My first step was data cleaning. I used pandas to clean the data by removing nulls, duplicates, and outliers. I used matplotlib and seaborn to make visual representations of the data. 

# Summary 
I decided to break the dataset down by categorized the crimes where an arrest was made and where an arrest was not made. There is a very heavy imbalance in the number of arrests and the number of not arrest. Over 75% of crimes did not result in an arrest which can be alarming. 

I wanted to see how differnt crimes can affect whether an arrest was made or not. I also want to see how often is crime happening. Also where is most of the crimal activity happening.
